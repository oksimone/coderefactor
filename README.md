To the viewer:

This is my first homework assignment in my fullstack bootcamp. Going into this assignment, I thought it'd be as simple as changing a couple of tags and classes. But it was much more than I had anticipated... I struggled a lot with trying to clean up the stylesheet. Everytime I tried to alter the CSS code, the webpage would change ever so slightly. I "Google FU'd" a lot of my questions, and I resolved a good bit of my CSS frustrations. 

However, I do believe that I had made significant changes to both the HTML code and the css code. Below describes how I went about making the changes. 

 Before I started "cleaning" up the code, I analyzed the entire HTML code as well as the stylesheet and noted a couple of things. 

1. There is no header section or navbar
2. There are multiple div's throughout the entire code. 
3. There is an aside and footer tag, but they're both wrapped in a div tag
4. I noticed that none of the images have alt tags
5. I also noticed that "Search Engine Optimization" doesn't have an id, like "Online Reputation Management" and "Social Media Marketing". 

From my code, I know that I needed to add the following:
1. a header section
2. a navbar inside the header section
3. a main element for the 3 different sections
4. an aside element
5. a footer section
6. change the title 

The first thing I did was change the header "div class" to "nav class." Then, I deleted the div tags that wrapped the <ul> and replaced them with <nav> tags. After that, I wrapped the nav tags with header tags.

- I felt that it wasn't necessary to change the hero tags.

- Then, I wrapped the three different sections and the aside in a main tag. 
- I then added section tags to the three different section 
- Then, I added an id to "search engine optimization" because it was missing in the original code. 
- I then added alt tags to the three photos on the page
- I then added aside tags
- I wrapped the footer content in a footer tag, and then changed the h2 tag to an h4 tag in the HTML code and the stylesheet.
- I changed the title of the page and a small description.
