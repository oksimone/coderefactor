To the viewer:

This is my first homework assignment in my coding bootcamp. Before I started "cleaning" up the code, I analyzed the entire HTML code as well as the stylesheet, and I've noticed a couple of things. 

1. There is no header section.
2. There are multiple div's throughout the entire code. 
3. There is an aside, but it's wrapped in a div tag
4. I noticed that none of the images have an alt tag
5. The footer is also wrapped in a div tag
6. I also noticed that "Search Engine Optimization" doesn't have an id, like "Online Reputation Management" and "Social Media Marketing". 

From my code, I know that I need the following:
1. a header section
2. a navbar inside the header section
3. a main element for the 3 different sections
4. an aside element
5. lastly, a footer section
6. change the title 

The first thing I did was change the header "div class" to "nav class." Then, I deleted the div tags that wrapped the <ul> and replaced them with <nav> tags. After that, I wrapped the nav tags with header tags.

I felt the need to leave the div "hero" wrapped in a div tag because using the other semantics wouldn't be necessary.

Then, I wrapped the three different sections and the aside in a main tag. 
I then added section tags to the three different sections. Then, I added an id to "search engine optimization" because it was missing in the original code. 
I then added alt tags to the three photos on the page
I then added aside tags
I wrapped the footer content in a footer tag, and then changed the h2 tag to an h4 tag in the HTML code and the stylesheet.
I changed the title of the page and a small description.
